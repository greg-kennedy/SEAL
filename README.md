This Github repository is a mirror of the original SEAL source code.  SEAL was a
cross-platform audio library, with ports for MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows, Linux, BeOS
and others.  It has not been updated in many years, but was a key component for
several games and applications of its time (including the MAME arcade emulator).

The latest available version is 1.0.7, with additional patches from the MAME
team to fix bugs and improve sound quality on certain Sound Blaster cards.

Please see README.txt for more information.
